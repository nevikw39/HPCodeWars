Once upon a midnight dreary while I pondered weak and weary ~
Mary sat musing on the lamp-flame at the table ~
Carrie's cat clawed her couch, creating chaos ~
The silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain ~
Hot hearted Beowulf was bent upon battle ~
The daily diary of the American dream ~
The famous families lived along eleven fancy lanes ~
Charmed rich duchesses cherish diamonds ~
